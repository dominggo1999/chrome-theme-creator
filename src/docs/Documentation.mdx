# What is the difference between Chromio with chrome built-in theme customizer?
Chrome has a built-in theme customizer , although the customization options are very limited. You can access it by visiting the new tab page and clicking the **customize this page** button in the bottom right corner.

Chromio provides more customization and flexibility, so you can create beautiful and creative themes like this

# Why if the background uses an image with .gif format and fill screen mode, the export time is very long ? 
If you use fill screen mode for the background image, then Chromio will resize the image during the export process. For static images with .png, .jpg, .jpeg format the resizing process will be very fast because it only consists of one frame, but images with .gif format consist of several frames (can be up to hundreds), and each frame needs to be resized.

***If you want to use fill screen mode with .gif background and don't want to wait long, you can use this method.***

1. Choose a background image, then do the customization you want.
2. When you are satisfied with the theme you created and want to export it, remove the background image. ( ***We'll add the background later***)
3. Export the theme
4. Install the theme
5. Open a new tab in chrome
6. Click Customize Chrome (at the bottom right corner)
7. Select the **Background** tab
8. Select **Upload from device**
9. Find the image you want to use as the background and Chrome will apply the background you want without any customization options. (defaults to **fill screen** and "center center")

***If you want to fully customize the background image and are willing to wait longer, just use Chromio***
